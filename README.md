# BOUN-Pars

BOUN-Pars is a deep learning-based dependency parser developed for Turkish. It is based on [Stanford's graph-based neural dependency parser](https://github.com/tdozat/Parser-v2) and uses linguistically oriented rules and benefits from morphological information of words.

BOUN-Pars creates dependency parse trees of Turkish sentences in CoNLL-U format.

The pre-processing steps of parsing from raw text: the segmentation, morphological tagging, and lemmatization tasks are performed by a pre-trained model by [TurkuNLP pipeline](https://turkunlp.org/Turku-neural-parser-pipeline/).

# Installation

The required packages for the pre-trained TurkuNLP pipeline model is listed [here](https://turkunlp.org/Turku-neural-parser-pipeline/install.html). 

After successfully installed the pre-trained TurkuNLP pipeline model, do the following steps:

* Navigate to Turku-neural-parser-pipeline folder.
* Clone the parser:
```
git clone https://github.com/sb-b/BOUN-PARS.git
```
* Put everything inside BOUN-PARS folder into Turku-neural-parser-pipeline folder:
```
mv BOUN-PARS/* .
```

## Parse Raw Text
In Turku-neural-parser-pipeline folder:

* Download and unpack the pre-trained morphology-based parser pipeline model :
```
wget http://tabilab.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/BOUN-PARS/model_tr_imst_ruled_morphed_pipeline.tgz
tar -xvf model_tr_imst_ruled_morphed_pipeline.tgz
```
run parse-text.sh:
```
sh parse-text.sh "bu örnek bir cümledir."
```

## Parse CoNLL-U File
To parse a CoNLL-U file:

* Navigate to Parser-hybrid/saves folder.

* Download and unpack the pre-trained morphology-based parser model :
```
wget http://tabilab.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/BOUN-PARS/model_tr_imst_ruled_morphed.tgz
tar -xvf model_tr_imst_ruled_morphed.tgz
```
* Run the following command in Turku-neural-parser-pipeline folder:
```
sh parse-from-conllu.sh input.conllu output.conllu
```
