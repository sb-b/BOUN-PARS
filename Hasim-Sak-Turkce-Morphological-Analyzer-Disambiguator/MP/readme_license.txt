The Boun Morphological Parser:
The morphological parser is a state-of-the-art finite-state transducer-based implementation of Turkish morphology. It is a probabilistic morphological parser, stochastized using the Boun web corpus and the Boun morphological disambiguator (Both is available at http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~hasim).
You can find the most up to date version at http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~hasim.
Please contact to hasim.sak@gmail.com, if you need the source code version for research purposes.

The Morphological Parser as a Python Extension:
The morphological parser can be run from the python script. An example script 'parse_corpus.py' is given.
To run the example script:
parse_corpus.py test.txt
